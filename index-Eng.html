			<p>This crime is revealed in various<br>forms in dierent surroundings.</p>
			<p>However, all of these forms are<br>believed to share common ground - <br>inequality between sexes and <br>systemic gender-based <br>discrimination.</p>

				<h3>War in Abkhazia</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="chapterIIWhiteSection">
				<p>The armed conict in Abkhazia started in 1992. 

				<br> <br>
				 Fighting between Georgian government troops and<br>part of separatist ethnic Abkhazians supported by the<br>Armenian Battalion of Bagramian, the North Cauca-<br>sian mercenaries and the Cossack armed forces lasted<br>for 13 months and 13 days.
				<br><br>
				The separatists were unocially backed by the Rus- <br>sian military base garrison in Gudauta. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="chapterIIBlackSection">
				<div class="chapterII-left">
					<p>
					During the conict, numerous military oenses have<br>been committed, including ethnic cleansing of <br>Georgians. During the war, tens of thousands of <br>people were killed from both sides.

					<br><br>
					According to the Red Cross study conducted in 1999,<br>90 percent of Abkhazians and 42 percent of Georgians<br>say they have experienced ‘negative eects’ of the<br>conict, including the killing or rape of relatives, the <br>looting or destruction of homes, or being taken as a<br>prisoner.

					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 25px;">DURING THE CONFLICT, 3 368 <br> CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED<br> ON THE TERRITORY OF <br>ABKHAZIA. 3 150 OF THEM<br> WERE GEORGIANS.</p>

					<p>as a result of 1992-1993 and 2008 wars in <br> Georgia, 2 400 people ae considered missing.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 30%;font-size: 14px;">This project has been produced with the assistance of the European Union.<br>Its contents are the sole responsibility of the Georgian Institute of Public<br>Aairs and can in no way be taken to reect the views of the European<br>Union.</p>

					<p>
					Despite the fact, that numerous scientic works and<br>publications have been dedicated to the armed<br>conict in Abkhazia, the issues on violence against<br>women and the victims of femicide have remained in<br>the shade, without paying proper attention to them.
					<br> <br><br>
					Unfortunately, the information about women killed<br>during the war in Abkhazia is not seen among other<br>cases considering the famicide issues during similar<br>conicts either.
					<br><br><br>
					25 years have passed since their painful and tragic<br>stories are kept in the memory of family members and<br>friends only.
					<br><br><br>
					Let's recall once again the chronicle of the war in<br>Abkhazia, but this time, we'll get to know a few<br>women whose biographies have been changed in this<br>chronicle forever.
